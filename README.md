 <!--<h2>What happens in 2023</h2>-->
 <h2>Hacktoberfest 2023</h2>

 Hacktoberfest is back, and so is YurisCodingClub, with two more projects to work and collaborate on.
 
<!--In order to have enough time and energy for personal growth in 2023 I have to step back a bit and decided that YurisCodingClub Open Source Organization will <b>be back for Hacktoberfest 2023</b>.

In the mean while keep practicing your skills and keep an eye at <a align="center" href="http://yuriscodingclub.com">the official website of YurisCodingClub</a> - challenges, newsletter, and much more is coming up soon.-->
 
     I have plenty ideas. So stay tuned for future projects üòé

Go to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/YurisCodingClub/discussions">discussion</a> section to read more about collaborating in one of YurisCodingClub projects.

<h2>Everyone is welcome ü§ù</h2>

<p>I switched careers to tech in my early thirties despite a completely different background.  <br />
    
        I especially want to encourage women and people with disabilities
        to become part of a community that supports each other in fulfilling our dream.
        
So no matter where you are right now, just do it.
