<p>This club helps career switchers get into web development and accessibility by learning how to code and contributing to open source.</p>
<p>I switched careers to tech in my early thirties despite a completely different background. <br />
    👩🏽 I encourage every woman out there to follow their dreams and get into coding as well.</p> 
<p>All projects are designed for UX designers, front-end developers, and QA tester to contribute to open source. <br />
    Many issues are <b>beginner friendly</b>. The projects are designed to help all career switchers contribute to open source and gain the necessary work experience to <a href="https://dev.to/yuridevat/how-to-write-a-promising-cv-32ih">boost their CV</a> and get a job.</p>

<h2>Nothing about us without us 🤝</h2>

<p>
    
    I especially encourage people using assistive technologies on a daily basis 
    (screen reader, magnifier, tab, braille, and more)
    to become part of a community to make the application accessible from the very beginning.
    Let's support each other and grow together in fulfilling our dreams.

So no matter where you are right now, just do it.

<!--<h2>What happens in 2023</h2>-->
 <h2>Hacktoberfest</h2>
 
 <!--Hacktoberfest is back, and so is YurisCodingClub, with two more projects to work and collaborate on.
 
In order to have enough time and energy for personal growth in 2023 I have to step back a bit and decided that YurisCodingClub Open Source Organization will <b>be back for Hacktoberfest 2023</b>.

In the mean while keep practicing your skills and keep an eye at <a align="center" href="http://yuriscodingclub.com">the official website of YurisCodingClub</a> - challenges, newsletter, and much more is coming up soon.-->
 
     I have plenty ideas. So stay tuned for future projects 😎
